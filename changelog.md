> As the ecosystem for 1.20.1 begins to wind down with major mods like Create moving on, we are also transitioning into
> the final maintenance phase for our mod on this version.

### 0.12.18.7

- Fixed a bug that would cause the time period to be judged as dusk at the beginning of the day.

### 0.12.18.6

- Optimized the snowfall schedule for `Regional Snow Time` datapack.
- Fixed a bug where the `Snow Together` data packet was not being applied.

### 0.12.18.5

* Removed the restriction that additional snow rendering could not be referenced without a seasonal dimension,
  maintaining better appearance consistency.

### 0.12.18.4

* Fixed an issue where rendered snow could unexpectedly melt in cold biomes without rainfall.

### 0.12.18.2

* Optimized several rendering settings related to the extra snow layer.

### 0.12.18.1

* When **forced compatibility** is enabled for modded leaves that do not support Forge events, and a **random tick event
  ** is triggered but the seasonal check fails, the leaves will now proceed with the **decay process**.
* Fixed an issue where the **`season_textures` resource pack** did not properly support the `start_season` field.
* Improved the **ParticleIcon detection logic** for models defined in the `season_textures` resource pack.

### 0.12.18

* Fixed an issue where **seasonal texture models** would not apply if in snowy status.
* Extra snow layer rendering on leaves now only applies to the **top side of leaves**, aligning more closely with
  vanilla behavior.
* Snow state is now initialized by default in **extremely cold biomes**.

Configuration:

* Added a new option: **ExtraSnowLayerCulling**.
* **SnowInFence** and **SnowInFenceOnlySnowy** are now **disabled by default**.
* Added compatibility **common config synchronization support** for **EclipticSeasonsBundles**.

### 0.12.17

- Added model-like face culling for snow inside fences and extra snow layers, reducing z-fighting at long distances.

### 0.12.16

- Added an automatic configuration synchronization system that syncs all Common config files between the server and
  client. If the client does not want their original settings to be restored after leaving a world, the enforcement
  option can be disabled in the configuration.
- Fixed several legacy issues.

### 0.12.15

- Added an optional **Extra Snow Layer** visual feature. When enabled, snowy blocks may render a thin additional snow
  layer based on the biome’s current snow depth, making snow accumulation appear more gradual and natural across the
  terrain. This effect works with **Sodium** and **Embeddium**.
- Renamed the internal block tag **`snow_layer_cannot_survive_on`** to **`snow_layer_cannot_survive_in`** to better
  reflect its purpose.

### 0.12.14

- Fixed several issues in Season Definitions, including deserialization errors, incorrect rule evaluation, and some
  feature placement problems.

#### 0.12.13

- HeatStroke has been adjusted to a progressive count, so you won't get heatstroke immediately or for long periods of
  time in the sun of summer.

#### 0.12.12.1

- Change the default for `RainTogether` in CommonConfig from false to true

#### 0.12.12

Update: Mixin Control Support

- New Feature: Added a dedicated configuration file for Mixins.
- Toggleable Mixins: You can now freely enable or disable specific Mixins to improve compatibility or customize your
  experience.

#### 0.12.11.5.1

- Default enable datapack option `RegionalSnowTime` to align snowfall schedules based on three broad climate zones (
  Warm, Temperate, and Cold) instead of per-biome.

#### 0.12.11.5

- Add option `VoxyReloadWhenSeasonChanged` to auto clean voxy cache when solar term changes.

#### 0.12.11.4

- Added the SimpleSeasonHud option, extracted from our debug information, intended for players who do not want to
  install additional HUD mods. As part of maintaining a healthy community ecosystem, no extra configuration options are
  provided.
- Optimized the biome color update logic.

#### 0.12.11.3

- Fixed an issue where **SolarTermChangeEvent** could not be received on the client logic thread.
- Aligned DH’s LOD update determination logic with that of **Voxy**.
- Season changes now also trigger LOD updates when the relevant option is enabled.

#### 0.12.11.2.1

- Optimized some rendering logic for vanilla blocks such as snow connecting to fences.

#### 0.12.11.2

* Fixed an issue where some runtime-built snow-covered models (such as snow-covered fences) were not generated correctly
  in Voxy rendering.
* Added the option **VoxyLODAutoReload**. This option now determines whether to automatically refresh LOD appearances
  based on changes in weather-related snow coverage.
* The essence of this compatibility is invoking Voxy’s world import process. Voxy currently stores LOD build results in
  its database, which makes direct modification of that data difficult. Adjusting the generation process of the build
  results is comparatively easier. Therefore, LODs can now also be updated manually by running
  `/voxy import world <world_name>` instead of relying on automatic updates. This approach reduces performance
  requirements and mitigates update overhead for very large worlds.

### 0.12.11

- Optimized Voxy compatibility code again, resolving some runtime conflicts and significantly improving performance.

> Note that this update may affect Voxy data. Please back up your Voxy database. If you enable the compatibility option
> and later wish to disable or uninstall this mod, make sure to reset the Voxy database.

#### 0.12.10.3

- Move the Voxy test compatibility control option from Client to Common

#### 0.12.10.2

- Updated the code for voxy compablity.

#### 0.12.10.1

- Adjust the greenhouse dark-light detection logic from "sky-light only" to include "supplementary light."

### 0.12.10

- All configuration comments have been improved to help players better understand the purpose of each option.
  Renaming of configuration entries will be carried out once the configuration migration system is ready.

> Unfortunately, my available time for mod development will be significantly reduced in the near future. I hope these
> recent updates can improve a large part of the overall experience.
> If you encounter issues or compatibility problems, please provide accurate testing results and isolated test cases
> when
> reporting them; otherwise, I may not have sufficient time to investigate and resolve the issue.

### 0.12.9

  matching surrounding
  terrain height for enhanced winter immersion.

### 0.12.7

  Ecliptic Seasons: Bundles provides basic DataPack and resource pack support for other biome or crop mods.
  Contributions to add or merge additional support are welcome and greatly appreciated.

### 0.12.6

- Due to bloom conflicts between foggy weather and certain shader packs (such as newer versions of Photon) under
  specific conditions, Foggy Weather is now disabled by default.
- Experimental compatibility with Voxy has been added. This feature must be enabled in the settings and requires a
  restart.
  Because Voxy’s design philosophy does not allow seasonal systems to directly intervene in its rendering pipeline, a
  special workaround is used. Please back up your world and modpack before enabling this option.
- Fixed an initialization issue with BigGlobe when Voxy compatibility is enabled.

### 0.12.5.8

- Added an option `DistantHorizonsWinterLODForceUpdateAll`, default false since it cause more performance time cost.

### 0.12.5.4

  not outside the Snowy season.
- Added the option SnowKeepInSnowyBiomes to reconcile the previous behavior of snow blocks.
